Condition monitoring of hydraulic systems
=========================================

Abtract: The data set addresses the condition assessment of a hydraulic test rig based on multi sensor data. Four fault types are superimposed with several severity grades impeding selective quantification.

The target condition values are cycle-wise annotated in ‘hydraulic.csv‘ (tab-delimited). The columns are

1: Cooler condition / %:
	3: close to total failure
	20: reduced effifiency
	100: full efficiency

2: Valve condition / %:
	100: optimal switching behavior
	90: small lag
	80: severe lag
	73: close to total failure

3: Internal pump leakage:
	0: no leakage
	1: weak leakage
	2: severe leakage

4: Hydraulic accumulator / bar:
	130: optimal pressure
	115: slightly reduced pressure
	100: severely reduced pressure
	90: close to total failure

5: stable flag:
	0: conditions were stable
	1: static conditions might not have been reached yet
